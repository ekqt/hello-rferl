# Hello, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty

My name is Hector Sosa, I am a full-stack developer from Honduras, Central America. Now based in the city of Brno, Czech Republic.

## Coding Test

The requested coding test was build on [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, styled on [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/) a modern and easy CSS framework that just works and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) a deployment and collaboration platform for frontend developers. 

Click here [hello-rferl.vercel.app](https://hello-rferl.vercel.app/) for the deployment.

Click here [github.com/ekqt/hello-rferl](https://github.com/ekqt/hello-rferl) to review the Git repository.
